20230531_1 WIP:
- tons of adjustments and changes to the core mechanics...

- decompiled "Pathos.dll", "PathosGame.exe" and "PathosEngine.dll" and added its sources to the solution. It was needed for me to achieve the modifications that I wanted. Other than that I was doing crazy extensions with delegates and such. Their source code are not going to be pushed to mey GitHub repo, only its updated binaries.

- new item "Ring of Bia-Vis" which is an artifact

- when the character has the Property "clairvoyance" he can bypass the need for "UseVision" and the "eyes" Anatomy

- actually, I modified PathosOfficial.Anatomy and included a new property "Property BypassedByProperty" so that any Anatomy entity can be suprassed by any given Property that the character may possess according to the designer. The same for Motions.

- new spells "absorption" and "protoplasmatic hands"

- new Property "protoplasmatic hands"

- added a bunch of new fields to Pathos.Format.cs and made respective changes to Pathos.HelpContext.cs so that I could accomodate the new methods that I created, mostly to support a diverse composition of casting for spells

- fixed some bugs of NullReference in Pathos.dll and PathosEngine.dll

- many changes in Reactor.cs, Engine.cs and Director.cs of PathosEngine.dll

- probably more stuff that I`m forgetting. It`s still a work in progress...
